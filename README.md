This is the Web Data Analysis Tool development project.

This client is written using the [Google Web Toolkit][1]. It has to be
compiled using the resources and tools available at [1][1]. The test deployment
is within on a server accessible only through a VPN to G-Node and so are
all the server APIs that WDAT uses. This makes it virtually impossible
to view what WDAT does. 

If more information is required, please contact [Andrey][2] or [Dipanjan][3].

Thanks.
