This is the Web Data Analysis Tool development project.

This client is written using the [Google Web Toolkit][1]. It has to be
compiled using the resources and tools available at [1][1]. 

The test deployment and the server API which WDAT is integrally tied
to, is hosted on a server which is accessible only through a VPN to
the g-node (German Node of INCF). 

We are in the process of making the data API's public. This will
enable developers to test, use and further improve WDAT. We expect the
process to be completed by mid-october 2011. If you are really
interested in contributing, please contact [Andrey][2] or
[Dipanjan][3] for details.

If further information is required, please contact [Andrey][2] or 
[Dipanjan][3].

Thanks.
G-Node @ INCF
